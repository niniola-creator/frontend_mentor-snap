# Frontend Mentor - Snap

This is my solution to the Snap challenge on Frontend Mentor. I built it using HTML, CSS, JavaScript & Bootstrap, and the goal was to recreate the design as closely as possible, both visually and functionally.


## Overview

I chose this challenge because it looked simple at first glance, but I knew it would require some attention to detail, especially when it comes to responsiveness and layout alignment. 


During the build, I got to flex my skills in:

* Working with media queries to handle different screen sizes. 

* Making a mobile-first layout. 

* Paying attention to accessibility and semantics. 

It reminded me how important it is to slow down and double-check spacing, font sizes, and other tiny details that really pull a UI together.


## Tools Used

- Semantic HTML5. 
- Custom CSS properties. 
- JavaScript. 
- Mobile-first workflows. 
- Bootstrap. 
- Frontend Mentor starter files.
